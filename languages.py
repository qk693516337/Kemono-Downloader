        <li><b>Important Tip: App '(Not Responding)'?</b><br>
          After clicking 'Start Download', especially for large creator feeds or with many threads, the application might temporarily show as '(Not Responding)'. Your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) might even suggest you 'End Process' or 'Force Quit'.<br>
          <b>Please be patient!</b> The app is often still working hard in the background. Before force-closing, try checking your chosen 'Download Location' in your file explorer. If you see new folders being created or files appearing, it means the download is progressing correctly. Give it some time to become responsive again.</li><br>
        <li>Use the <b>Next</b> and <b>Back</b> buttons to navigate.</li><br>
        <li>Many options have tooltips if you hover over them for more details.</li><br>

        <ul>
        <li><b>🔗 Kemono Creator/Post URL:</b><br>
          Paste the full web address (URL) of a creator's page (e.g., <i>https://kemono.su/patreon/user/12345</i>) 
        or a specific post (e.g., <i>.../post/98765</i>).</li><br>
          or a Coomer creator (e.g., <i>https://coomer.su/onlyfans/user/artistname</i>) 
        <li><b>📁 Download Location:</b><br>
          Click 'Browse...' to choose a folder on your computer where all downloaded files will be saved. 
        This is required unless you are using 'Only Links' mode.</li><br>
        <li><b>📄 Page Range (Creator URLs only):</b><br>
          If downloading from a creator's page, you can specify a range of pages to fetch (e.g., pages 2 to 5). 
        Leave blank for all pages. This is disabled for single post URLs or when <b>Manga/Comic Mode</b> is active.</li>
        </ul>""",
"tour_dialog_step3_title":"② Filtering Downloads",
"tour_dialog_step3_content":"""Refine what you download with these filters (most are disabled in 'Only Links' or 'Only Archives' modes):
        <ul>
        <li><b>🎯 Filter by Character(s):</b><br>
          Enter character names, comma-separated (e.g., <i>Tifa, Aerith</i>). Group aliases for a combined folder name: <i>(alias1, alias2, alias3)</i> becomes folder 'alias1 alias2 alias3' (after cleaning). All names in the group are used as aliases for matching.<br>
          The <b>'Filter: [Type]'</b> button (next to this input) cycles how this filter applies:
          <ul><li><i>Filter: Files:</i> Checks individual filenames. A post is kept if any file matches; only matching files are downloaded. Folder naming uses the character from the matching filename (if 'Separate Folders' is on).</li><br>
            <li><i>Filter: Title:</i> Checks post titles. All files from a matching post are downloaded. Folder naming uses the character from the matching post title.</li>
            <li><b>⤵️ Add to Filter Button (Known Names):</b> Next to the 'Add' button for Known Names (see Step 5), this opens a popup. Select names from your <code>Known.txt</code> list via checkboxes (with a search bar) to quickly add them to the 'Filter by Character(s)' field. Grouped names like <code>(Boa, Hancock)</code> from Known.txt will be added as <code>(Boa, Hancock)~</code> to the filter.</li><br>
            <li><i>Filter: Both:</i> Checks post title first. If it matches, all files are downloaded. If not, it then checks filenames, and only matching files are downloaded. Folder naming prioritizes title match, then file match.</li><br>
            <li><i>Filter: Comments (Beta):</i> Checks filenames first. If a file matches, all files from the post are downloaded. If no file match, it then checks post comments. If a comment matches, all files are downloaded. (Uses more API requests). Folder naming prioritizes file match, then comment match.</li></ul>
          This filter also influences folder naming if 'Separate Folders by Name/Title' is enabled.</li><br>
        <li><b>🚫 Skip with Words:</b><br>
          Enter words, comma-separated (e.g., <i>WIP, sketch, preview</i>). 
          The <b>'Scope: [Type]'</b> button (next to this input) cycles how this filter applies:
          <ul><li><i>Scope: Files:</i> Skips files if their names contain any of these words.</li><br>
            <li><i>Scope: Posts:</i> Skips entire posts if their titles contain any of these words.</li><br>
            <li><i>Scope: Both:</i> Applies both file and post title skipping (post first, then files).</li></ul></li><br>

          <li><i>All:</i> Downloads all file types found.</li><br>
          <li><i>Images/GIFs:</i> Only common image formats and GIFs.</li><br>

"tour_dialog_step6_title":"⑤ Organization & Performance",
"tour_dialog_step6_content":"""Organize your downloads and manage performance:
        <ul>
        <li><b>⚙️ Separate Folders by Name/Title:</b> Creates subfolders based on the 'Filter by Character(s)' input or post titles (can use the <b>Known.txt</b> list as a fallback for folder names).</li><br>
        <li><b>Subfolder per Post:</b> If 'Separate Folders' is on, this creates an additional subfolder for <i>each individual post</i> inside the main character/title folder.</li><br>
        <li><b>🚀 Use Multithreading (Threads):</b> Enables faster operations. The number in 'Threads' input means:
          <ul><li>For <b>Creator Feeds:</b> Number of posts to process simultaneously. Files within each post are downloaded sequentially by its worker (unless 'Date Based' manga naming is on, which forces 1 post worker).</li><br>
            <li>For <b>Single Post URLs:</b> Number of files to download concurrently from that single post.</li></ul>
          If unchecked, 1 thread is used. High thread counts (e.g., >40) may show an advisory.</li><br>
        <li><b>Multi-part Download Toggle (Top-right of log area):</b><br>
          The <b>'Multi-part: [ON/OFF]'</b> button allows enabling/disabling multi-segment downloads for individual large files. 
          <ul><li><b>ON:</b> Can speed up large file downloads (e.g., videos) but may increase UI choppiness or log spam with many small files. An advisory will appear when enabling. If a multi-part download fails, it retries as single-stream.</li><br>
            <li><b>OFF (Default):</b> Files are downloaded in a single stream.</li></ul>
          This is disabled if 'Only Links' or 'Only Archives' mode is active.</li><br>
        <li><b>📖 Manga/Comic Mode (Creator URLs only):</b> Tailored for sequential content.
          <ul>
          <li>Downloads posts from <b>oldest to newest</b>.</li><br>
          <li>The 'Page Range' input is disabled as all posts are fetched.</li><br>
          <li>A <b>filename style toggle button</b> (e.g., 'Name: Post Title') appears in the top-right of the log area when this mode is active for a creator feed. Click it to cycle through naming styles:
            <ul>
            <li><b><i>Name: Post Title (Default):</i></b> The first file in a post is named after the post's cleaned title (e.g., 'My Chapter 1.jpg'). Subsequent files within the *same post* will attempt to keep their original filenames (e.g., 'page_02.png', 'bonus_art.jpg'). If the post has only one file, it's named after the post title. This is generally recommended for most manga/comics.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Name: Original File:</i></b> All files attempt to keep their original filenames. An optional prefix (e.g., 'MySeries_') can be entered in the input field that appears next to the style button. Example: 'MySeries_OriginalFile.jpg'.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Name: Title+G.Num (Post Title + Global Numbering):</i></b> All files across all posts in the current download session are named sequentially using the post's cleaned title as a prefix, followed by a global counter. For example: Post 'Chapter 1' (2 files) -> 'Chapter 1_001.jpg', 'Chapter 1_002.png'. The next post, 'Chapter 2' (1 file), would continue the numbering -> 'Chapter 2_003.jpg'. Multithreading for post processing is automatically disabled for this style to ensure correct global numbering.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Name: Date Based:</i></b> Files are named sequentially (001.ext, 002.ext, ...) based on post publication order. An optional prefix (e.g., 'MySeries_') can be entered in the input field that appears next to the style button. Example: 'MySeries_001.jpg'. Multithreading for post processing is automatically disabled for this style.</li>
            </ul>
          </li><br>
          <li>For best results with 'Name: Post Title', 'Name: Title+G.Num', or 'Name: Date Based' styles, use the 'Filter by Character(s)' field with the manga/series title for folder organization.</li>
          </ul></li><br>
        <li><b>🎭 Known.txt for Smart Folder Organization:</b><br>
          <code>Known.txt</code> (in the app's directory) allows fine-grained control over automatic folder organization when 'Separate Folders by Name/Title' is active.
          <ul>
            <li><b>How it Works:</b> Each line in <code>Known.txt</code> is an entry. 
              <ul><li>A simple line like <code>My Awesome Series</code> means content matching this will go into a folder named "My Awesome Series".</li><br>
                <li>A grouped line like <code>(Character A, Char A, Alt Name A)</code> means content matching "Character A", "Char A", OR "Alt Name A" will ALL go into a single folder named "Character A Char A Alt Name A" (after cleaning). All terms in the parentheses become aliases for that folder.</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Intelligent Fallback:</b> When 'Separate Folders by Name/Title' is active, and if a post doesn't match any specific 'Filter by Character(s)' input, the downloader consults <code>Known.txt</code> to find a matching primary name for folder creation.</li><br>
            <li><b>User-Friendly Management:</b> Add simple (non-grouped) names via the UI list below. For advanced editing (like creating/modifying grouped aliases), click <b>'Open Known.txt'</b> to edit the file in your text editor. The app reloads it on next use or startup.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>""",
"tour_dialog_step7_title":"⑥ Common Errors & Troubleshooting",
"tour_dialog_step7_content":"""Sometimes, downloads might encounter issues. Here are a few common ones:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Character Input Tooltip:</b><br>
          Enter character names, comma-separated (e.g., <i>Tifa, Aerith</i>).<br>
          Group aliases for a combined folder name: <i>(alias1, alias2, alias3)</i> becomes folder 'alias1 alias2 alias3'.<br>
          All names in the group are used as aliases for matching content.<br><br>
          The 'Filter: [Type]' button next to this input cycles how this filter applies:<br>
          - Filter: Files: Checks individual filenames. Only matching files are downloaded.<br>
          - Filter: Title: Checks post titles. All files from a matching post are downloaded.<br>
          - Filter: Both: Checks post title first. If no match, then checks filenames.<br>
          - Filter: Comments (Beta): Checks filenames first. If no match, then checks post comments.<br><br>
          This filter also influences folder naming if 'Separate Folders by Name/Title' is enabled.</li><br>      
        <li><b>502 Bad Gateway / 503 Service Unavailable / 504 Gateway Timeout:</b><br>
          These usually indicate temporary server-side problems with Kemono/Coomer. The site might be overloaded, down for maintenance, or experiencing issues. <br>
          <b>Solution:</b> Wait a while (e.g., 30 minutes to a few hours) and try again later. Check the site directly in your browser.</li><br>
        <li><b>Connection Lost / Connection Refused / Timeout (during file download):</b><br>
          This can happen due to your internet connection, server instability, or if the server drops the connection for a large file. <br>
          <b>Solution:</b> Check your internet. Try reducing the number of 'Threads' if it's high. The app might prompt to retry some failed files at the end of a session.</li><br>
        <li><b>IncompleteRead Error:</b><br>
          The server sent less data than expected. Often a temporary network hiccup or server issue. <br>
          <b>Solution:</b> The app will often mark these files for a retry attempt at the end of the download session.</li><br>
        <li><b>403 Forbidden / 401 Unauthorized (less common for public posts):</b><br>
          You might not have permission to access the content. For some paywalled or private content, using the 'Use Cookie' option with valid cookies from your browser session might help. Ensure your cookies are fresh.</li><br>
        <li><b>404 Not Found:</b><br>
          The post or file URL is incorrect, or the content has been removed from the site. Double-check the URL.</li><br>
        <li><b>'No posts found' / 'Target post not found':</b><br>
          Ensure the URL is correct and the creator/post exists. If using page ranges, make sure they are valid for the creator. For very new posts, there might be a slight delay before they appear in the API.</li><br>
        <li><b>General Slowness / App '(Not Responding)':</b><br>
          As mentioned in Step 1, if the app seems to hang after starting, especially with large creator feeds or many threads, please give it time. It's likely processing data in the background. Reducing thread count can sometimes improve responsiveness if this is frequent.</li>

                        <li>Each line is an entry.</li>
                        <li><b>Simple Name:</b> e.g., <code>My Awesome Series</code>. Content matching this will go into a folder named "My Awesome Series".</li>
                        <li><b>Grouped Aliases:</b> e.g., <code>(Character A, Char A, Alt Name A)</code>. Content matching "Character A", "Char A", OR "Alt Name A" will ALL go into a single folder named "Character A Char A Alt Name A" (after cleaning). All terms in the parentheses become aliases for that folder.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Usage:</b> Serves as a fallback for folder naming if a post doesn't match your active 'Filter by Character(s)' input. You can manage simple entries via the UI or edit the file directly for complex aliases. The app reloads it on startup or next use.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b><code>cookies.txt</code> (Optional):</b>
            <ul>
                <li>If you use the 'Use Cookie' feature and don't provide a direct cookie string or browse to a specific file, the application will look for a file named <code>cookies.txt</code> in its directory.</li>
                <li><b>Format:</b> Must be in Netscape cookie file format.</li>
                <li><b>Usage:</b> Allows the downloader to use your browser's login session for accessing content that might be behind a login on Kemono/Coomer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>First-Time User Tour</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>On the first launch (or if reset), a welcome tour dialog appears, guiding you through the main features. You can skip it or choose to "Never show this tour again."</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Many UI elements also have tooltips that appear when you hover your mouse over them, providing quick hints.</em></p>
